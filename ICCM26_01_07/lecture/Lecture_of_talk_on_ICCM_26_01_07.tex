    % \section{Algebraic Dynamics}

    \subsection{}
    
        Algebraic dynamics is ``dynamics in the setting of algebraic geometry''.

        The base field is an algebraically closed field \(\kkk\) with characteristic \(0\), usually \(\bbC\) or \(\overline{\bbQ}\).

        An \emph{algebraic dynamical system} is a pair \((X,f)\) where \(X\) is a variety over \(\kk\) and \(f\colon X\dashrightarrow X\) is a dominant rational self-map.

        Here we focus on the case that \(X\) is smooth and projective, and \(f\) is an endomorphism.

    \subsection{}

        First we introduce some basic invariants of algebraic dynamical systems.

        \begin{definition}[(The first) dynamical degree]\label{def: delta_f}
            % The \emph{first dynamical degree} \(\delta_f\) of \(f\) is defined to be the following limit
            % \[
            % \delta_f := \lim_{n\to\infty}((f^n)^*H\cdot H^{\dim X-1})^{1/n}\in\mathbb{R}_{\geq 1},
            % \]
            % where $H$ is an ample Cartier divisor on \(X\).
        \end{definition}

        \begin{definition}[Arithmetic degree]\label{def: alpha_f}
            % Let \(h:X(\overline{\bbQ}) \to \bbR\) be the height function associated to an ample divisor on \(X\).
            % Then for every \(x\in X(\kkk)\), we define the \emph{arithmetic degree of \(f\) at \(x\)} by
            % \[
            %     \alpha_f(x)=\lim_{n\to\infty} \max\{h(f^n(x)),1\}^{1/n} \in \mathbb{R}_{\geq 1}.
            % \]
        \end{definition}

        Note that dynamical degree is a global invariant of the map \(f\), while arithmetic degree is a local invariant at the point \(x\).
        Therefore, it is natural to ask about the relation between these two invariants.
        Kawaguchi-Silverman conjectured the following.

    \subsection{}

        Suppose that this point \(x\) has a Zariski dense (forward) orbit.
        Somehow this means that \(x\) can reflect the global dynamics of \(f\) on \(X\).
        Then we expect that the arithmetic degree at \(x\) equals to the dynamical degree of \(f\).
        \begin{conjecture}[{Kawaguchi-Silverman Conjecture $=$ KSC}]\label{conj: ksc} 
            % Let $x \in X(\kkk)$, and suppose that the (forward) orbit $O_f(x) = \{f^n(x)\, |\, n\ge 0\}$  is Zariski dense in $X$.
            % Then the arithmetic degree at $x$ is equal to the dynamical degree of $f$, i.e.,
            % $\alpha_f(x) = \delta_f$.
        \end{conjecture} 

        So far KSC is still wide open in general.
        A useful method to study KSC is to use equivariant fibrations.
        That is, we have a dominant rational map \(\pi\colon X \dashrightarrow Y\) and a dominant rational map \(g\colon Y \dashrightarrow Y\) such that the following diagram commutes:
        \[
        \begin{tikzcd}
            X \arrow{r}{f} \arrow[dashed]{d}{\pi} & X \arrow[dashed]{d}{\pi} \\
            Y \arrow{r}{g} & Y.
        \end{tikzcd}
        \]
        Suppose further that \(\delta_f = \delta_g\).
        Then KSC for \((X,f)\) can be reduced to KSC for \((Y,g)\).
        Therefore, it is important to study when such fibrations exist.

    \subsection{}

        A fibration \(\pi: X \dashrightarrow Y\) is said to be \emph{\(f\)-equivariant} if there is a dominant rational map \(g: Y \dashrightarrow Y\) such that \(\pi \circ f = g \circ \pi\).

        Given a fibration \(\pi: X \to Y\) induced by a semiample divisor \(D\).
        Suppose that \(f^*D \equiv q D\) for some \(q > 0\), then by rigidity lemma and elementary intersection theory, \(\pi\) is \(f\)-equivariant.

        In algebraic geometry, Iitaka fibration is a very important fibration associated to an effective divisor.
        Therefore, it is natural to ask how to give a dynamical analogue of Iitaka fibration.

    % \section{Dynamical Iitaka Theory}
    \subsection{}

        Professor Meng and Zhang recently developed a dynamical analogue of Iitaka theory.
        Here I will briefly introduce some main results in their paper \cite{MZ23b}.

        First we need to extend the definition of Iitaka dimension to the setting of algebraic dynamics.

        \begin{definition}[Dynamical Iitaka dimension]
            % Let \(D\) be a Cartier divisor on \(X\).
            % The \emph{dynamical $f$-Iitaka dimension} of $D$ is defined as 
            % $$\kappa_f(X,D):=\max\left\{\kappa(X,D')\,|\,D'=\sum_{i=0}^m a_i (f^*)^iD, a_i\in\bbZ\right\}.$$
        \end{definition}

        Then we have the following result about the existence of dynamical Iitaka fibration.

        \begin{theorem}[{ref. \cite[Theorem 4.6]{MZ23b}}]
            % Suppose that $\kappa_f(X,D)\ge 0$.
            % Then there is an $f$-equivariant dominant rational map 
            % \[ f \acts X \dashrightarrow Y \racts f|_Y \]
            % with \(Y\) normal projective of dimension \(\kappa_f(X,D)\) and \(f|_Y\) a surjective endomorphism.
        \end{theorem}

    \subsection{}

        Using dynamical Iitaka fibration, we can try to classify algebraic dynamical systems \((X,f)\).
        In classical theory, varieties are classified according to the Kodaira dimension, i.e., Iitaka dimension of the canonical divisor \(K_X\).
        In the dynamical setting, we will consider the dynamical Iitaka dimension of the ramification divisor \(R_f = K_X - f^*K_X\).
        It is always effective.
        Hence we have the following three cases.

    \subsection{}

        \begin{itemize}
            \item $\kappa_f(X,R_f)=0$. (log \'etale case)
                % Then $f^{-1}(\Supp R_f)=\Supp R_f$ and the restriction $$f|_{X\backslash \Supp R_f}\colon X\backslash \Supp R_f\to X\backslash \Supp R_f$$ is (quasi-)\'etale.
            
            \item $0<\kappa_f(X,R_f)<\dim X$. (intermediate case)
                % We then have an $f$-equivariant dominant rational map
                % $$\varphi_{f,R_f}\colon X\dashrightarrow Y$$
                % with $0<\dim Y=\kappa_f(X,R_f)<\dim X$.

            \item $\kappa_f(X,R_f)=\dim X$. (big case)
                % In this case, $R_{f^s}$ is big when $s\gg 1$.
        \end{itemize}

    % \section{About our paper}
    \subsection{}

        We consider the case the \((X,f)\) has admitted an \(f\)-equivariant extremal Fano contraction \(\pi: X \to Y\) such that \(\delta_f > \delta_{f|_Y}\).

        Since \(\pi\) is of relative Picard number 1, the general fiber \(X_y\) is Fano and \(\delta_f > \delta_{f|_Y} \geq 1\), the ramification divisor \(R_f\) is non-trivial and \(\pi\)-ample.

        Hence we want to use the dynamical Iitaka fibration associated to \(R_f\) to get another \(f\)-equivariant fibration.

        Further assume that the base \(Y\) is either an abelian variety or a smooth projective variety of Picard number one, we get our main results.


        \begin{theorem}[Main Theorem 1]
            % Let $f$ be a surjective endomorphism of a smooth projective variety $X$ admitting an extremal Fano contraction $\pi:X\to Y$ to an abelian variety $Y$ of positive dimension.
            % Suppose $f$ admits a Zariski dense orbit and $\delta_f>\delta_{f|_Y}$.
            % Then the following hold.
            % \begin{enumerate}
            %     \item The ramification divisor satisfies $f^*R_f\equiv \delta_f R_f$.
            %     \item There exists an $f$-equivariant dominant rational map $\varphi:X\dashrightarrow Z$, 
            %     which is the $f$-Iitaka fibration of $R_f$, 
            %     such that $0<\dim Z<\dim X$ and $f|_Z$ is $\delta_f$-polarized.
            % \end{enumerate}
        \end{theorem}

        \begin{theorem}[Main Theorem 2]
            % Let $f$ be a surjective endomorphism of a smooth projective variety $X$ admitting an $f$-equivariant {\bf smooth} extremal Fano contraction $\pi:X\to Y$ with $\rho(Y)=1$.
            % Suppose $\delta_f>\delta_{f|_Y}=1$.
            % Then the following hold.
            % \begin{enumerate}
            %     \item The ramification divisor satisfies $f^*R_f\equiv \delta_f R_f$.
            %     \item There exists an $f$-equivariant dominant rational map $\varphi:X\dashrightarrow Z$, 
            %     which is the $f$-Iitaka fibration of $R_f$, 
            %     such that $0<\dim Z<\dim X$ and $f|_Z$ is $\delta_f$-polarized.
            % \end{enumerate}
        \end{theorem}

        As a direct application of our main results, we can prove KSC for such varieties.

        % \begin{corollary}\label{maincor: abelian}
        %     KSC holds for any smooth projective variety $X$ admitting an extremal Fano contraction to an abelian variety. 
        % \end{corollary}

        % \begin{corollary}\label{maincor: pn}
        %     KSC holds for any $\mathbb{P}^n$-bundle over either a $Q$-abelian variety or a smooth projective variety of Picard number one. 
        % \end{corollary}
